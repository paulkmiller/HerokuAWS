                <h3>Pro's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Heroku offers PasS, i.e. Platform as a Service. PaaS gives you an environment where you just push code and some basic configuration and get a running applicatoin</li>
                    <li>You can deploy your app by pushing your code into a git repo provided by Heroku</li>
                    <li>No system maintenance required; all handled by Heroku</li>
                    <li>You can easily install multiple horizontal app instances on Heroku</li>
                    <li>Web interface is easy to use and well designed</li>
                    <li>Easy to add other services through add-ons</li>
                    <li>Heroku automatically load balances and routes visitors to all available dynos</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Con's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>Heroku is free to use for the first dyno. The cost increases steeply as you increase dynos. When this because an actual conversation is when we reach the point that we're forced to think about ease vs money</li>
                    <li>CLI client works well for the most part except it can't manage multiple Heroku accounts</li>
                    <li>Can't save any files on Heroku explicitly; only achieved through pushing into the git repo</li>
                    <li>No way to increase RAM, storage, or CPU performance.</li>
                    <li>Additional storage must be hosted separately through a service like Amazon S3</li>
                    <li>Application performance can only be improved by increasing the number of running dynos</li>
                    <li>No other services (like Redis) can be run on dynos. Dynos are strictly for application processes. Databases, background workers, and other services usually cost extra through Heroku's add-ons or third-party services</li>
                    <li>No way to install system software. Heroku does provide some commonly-used packages such as ImageMagik, but if we need anything else, it's hack time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pro's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>AWS offers IaaS, i.e. Infrastruction as a Service. IaaS gives you components you need in order to build things on top of it</li>
                    <li>Larger apps are better suited for AWS in terms of cost</li>
                    <li>You have control over the file system in AWS; just clike a dedicated server with root access</li>
                    <li>Easy to upgrade hardware requirements according to our needs</li>
                    <li>Can run services like Redis or delayed job easily on AWS</li>
                    <li>You can install any system software like wkhtmltopdf or ImageMagik easily</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Con's</h3>
                <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>You have to deploy your application yourself, either through Chef recipes, Capistrano, or manually</li>
                    <li>You have to administer the system yourself. EC2 has machine images of popular distros such as Ubuntu that are easily launched, but after that, it's up to us to keep it up to date and secure</li>
                    <li>Scaling horizontally (i.e. launching multiple app instances) is not as easy as with Heroku. With Heroku, you move a slider on their web interface, but with AWS, you better get familiar with Chef if you intend to scale up / down frequently
                    </li>
                    <li>AWS is more expensive for the basic offering. There is a free tier that will give you one free micro instance for the first year (only available when you first sign up) but this is not as generous as Heroku's free, unlimited, single
                        dyno apps. </li>
                    <li>Not as easy as Heroku simply because it isn't managed.</li>
